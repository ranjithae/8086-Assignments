# Regsitered Death figures in England and Wales
This datset gives us a picture on the death rates in England and wales. It has monthly values for each specific place of England and wales. I have chosen the death rates sheet for the current year. 
And so, this dataset has the death rates until the month of July. These figures are the death registered by areas of usual residence.

This is an excel file. The dataset gives us the accurate numbers in particular to each place in England and wales, also a whole number. Below are the headers included in this file.
*	Area of usual residence ID 
*	Name of area.
*	Months (Jan 2017 – July 2017)

Few of the questions this data might help us to answer  
1. This data helps us to keep track on the death rates.  
2. It would help to analyze area wise death rates and do research on the reason if required.  
3. It seems all this are registered on the *General Register Office's Registration Online (RON) system*, may be there might some which are not registered and still missing, which helps to find if any illegal activities being carried out in the country 

The term and condition related to license policy is mentioned within the excel file in a sheet and it can also be viewed online [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/help/termsandconditions)
