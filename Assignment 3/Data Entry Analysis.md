# Data Analysis on Plankton Study

## Task 1:  List of problems in the provided data.
 
 The data provided is redundant and can be improvised for better results.  There are few other factors we need to consider for better results on the plankton study. Certain errors that I found from the data are as follows. 
* The Column Headers are not consistent across the three files.
* There are blanks on certain fields, which would make the data inefficient to gather results.
* The File naming can be made better by providing versions in that way it would be easy to track and consistent.
* There are varying columns among the three sheets. Its good to maintain consistent column every year.
* It’s clearly mentioned that the scientists collect data twice but nowhere the time it is captured in the spreadsheet.  
We can add time also with the date coulmn to the readings.
* There are three samples for each depth on a daily basis, but it is mentioned that readings are taken twice.  There is no understanding on the three readings provided.
* The graph plotted in both spreadsheets are for different columns. And the x and y values are not mentioned for these graphs.
* There are few fields highlighted in the spreadsheet and no explanation is mentioned.

### Additional Ideas: 
> This would be my suggestion to organize the data based on the depth level.The depth should be a separate category to differentiate the samples collected has they are collected from different layers.  Not sure if we can draw conclusion for samples collected from various depths.  In this way we can easily figure out the growth measure like the cuni or Chippo density by looking at the table.

Below mentioned can be added columns to the spreadsheet that can help in providing better and quick understanding on the study.
* Oxygen Content
* Minerals content( Phospate, nitrate & Silicic acid) 
* Vitamin B  

## Task 2:
**File Name:** PlanktonStudy V.0
> I would like to have the date, depth and temp column first has they have the repeated values that makes easier to the researcher or the target audience.

| Date & Time | Depth | Temp | Cuni Density | Cuni Colony Size | Chippo Density | Chippo Colony Size | Cholorphyla | Oxygen Level | Mineral Value | Vitamin B |
|------|-------|------|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
|      |       |      |              |                  |                |                    |             |              |               |           |
