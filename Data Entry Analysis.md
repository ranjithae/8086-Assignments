# Data Analysis on Plankton Study

## Task 1:  List of problems in the provided data.
 
 The data provided is redundant and can be improvised for better results.  There are few other factors we need to consider for better results on the plankton study. Certain errors that I found from the data are as follows. 
* It’s clearly mentioned that the scientists collect data twice but nowhere it is captured in the spreadsheet.  
We can add a column to capture the time the readings are noted.
* The depth should be a separate category to differentiate the samples collected has they are collected from different layers.  It isn't right to have a common graph that represents data for samples collected at various depths.
* There are three samples for each depth on a daily basis, but it is mentioned that readings are taken twice.  There is no understanding on the three readings provided.
* The depth should be a separate category to differentiate the samples collected has they are collected from different layers.  Not sure if we can draw conclusion for samples collected from various depths.  In this way we can easily figure out the growth measure like the cuni or Chippo density by looking at the table.
* The headings of the columns are not clear on the Zoom-temp spreadsheet. Also there are certain cells left blank which is not efficient.
In Zoom-temp excel sheet they have taken the average on the colony size for each day, doesn’t make any sense unless proper heading is mentioned.

Below mentioned can be added columns to the spreadsheet that can help in providing better and quick understanding on the study.
* Oxygen Content
* Minerals content 
* Fertilization level
* Salinity
